I\nhad read about the game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wolfenstein 3D</a>, which used a\nvery simple implementation of two-dimensional raycasting, and wanted to give it a try for myself.\nThis is my rather poor implementation in Processing. The walls aren\'t smooth because of quantization\nI failed to account for, and the color sampling code that would have let the image defining the map\nto also specify the color of the walls was unfinished. I remember that when I was writing the code I\nwas waiting for a ride home from school. So I was trying to finish it as quickly as possible,\nfrantically typing on the tiny keyboard of my beloved EEE PC, sitting on the school\'s steps.</p>\n<p>You can check out <a href="https://github.com/jmptable/rendering-like-wolfenstein" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">the code on GitHub</a>.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Wolfenstein-like Rendering",date:"20.06.2011",description:"",cover:{publicURL:"/static/game-like-wolfenstein-8ba1a73752ebe0bbdf6964ea9ae5c56b.gif",childImageSharp:null}},fields:{slug:"/wolfenstein-like-rendering"},excerpt:"This is a tiny rendering experiment from when I was in high school.
